A few years have passed since then and most germans banks are still the same. Meanwhile you get instant wire transfers in a few countries.

When I think Deutsche Bank and innovation, I think of my phone calls with Deutsche Bank about disappearing money and them telling me that I shouldn't be surprised if the online banking doesn't actually reflect my real balance and 3 day same country wire transfers. A friend of mine has a consulting company that claims that theyre trying to change their internal structures though.

I think of shitty support and paper faxes because of "security". The latter might actually be a prevalent problem in german society though.

I work in Gvt. Healthcare. They've been spending 1 year trying to define an API for activating the new healthcare smartcards. It has 3 API calls, it's not done yet, and it's SOAP only. And then the leadership has been trying to get government support to mandate by law the forced usage of their crappy APIs.

Germany is a digital dinosaur, no matter how much these old tycoons come to the bay area with their newly appointed chief of innovations for a week they won't get it, because they never had to compete on anything to get it.

User experience is a completely foreign concept to them.`,

The explosive growth of the industrial revolution, the reordering of society in the enlightenment, and everything we call modern and progressive is associated with a sequence of events that is also tightly correlated with the birth of peer review. Most philosophers of science don't consider this a coincidence. Science gave birth to exponential progress, and science itself is dependent on peer review.

Maybe the integration of peer review into practical industries, medical studies, and government regulation came later. But those were cases of taking something that worked astonishingly well and apply it to other domains. It's hardly fair to say that peer review "started" in the 1960's or 70's.`,

Thnik about it: precut veggies stored in refrigerated (probably plastic) containers. Somebody has to supply and prepare the veggies. Some other human has to resupply the machine when it runs out of veggies. Some other human has to fix the vending machine when it stops working. Some other humans have to design the machine and assemble it, at least in part. With an actual human you'd only have to supply the raw veggies and the human worker would do all the preparation (using food processors), serving and processing payments. One could automate some tasks like payment processing or have two humans operate the salad bar: one that prepares and serves the salads and one that processes payments. This would avoid cooks switching between working with (dirty) cash and preparing salads.",

Stock buybacks are an incredibly inefficient way of increasing CEO pay. Especially if they involve taking on debt.

We need to tax corporate dividends, interest paid, and stock buybacks at the same rate. There's a bias against dividends and in favor of debt in tax law, and that's why companies take on so much debt. It's a subsidy program for the banking industry, which is why it's hard to change in the US. It doesn't particularly help non-financial corporations.

Also, "private equity" is mostly debt financing in disguise. It's not people putting up their own cash. There's usually a little cash, and a lot of debt.

Something worth realizing: relative tax rates between business alternatives have a large effect on corporate behavior. Absolute tax rates, not so much. As capital gains rates have gone up and down over the years, capital expenditures haven't followed.

Imagine paying for 50mb/s internet and only getting 23mb/s. So you upgrade to the 75mb/s plan and now your real speed is 46mb/s. Why couldn't you get that higher speed for the original plan? It seems bizarre that this setup would be legal anywhere in any country.

If you can simply provide "up to" on something, then I wanna sell you a box for ten bucks that contains up to a million dollars!

Edit: Obviously speed depends on a million factors, but I don't know if I've ever experienced even half the speed I was paying for, even when I control both end points.`,

This is an appropriate time to show appreciation and support for the companies who are trying to demonstrate successful revenue models which are NOT based on advertising:

Medium - the replacement of “Recommends” with “Claps” was to allow Medium to better understand how much authors should be paid (with the money coming from the paid “Medium Member” plan). [1]

Patreon - probably the most popular service for paying independent content creators today. If you are a regular consumer of a content channel who’s creator is on Patreon and you haven’t already set up micro payments, then please part with a few pennies and help show the industry that an advertising revenue model isn’t the only option.

Wikipedia - Ad-free since its inception, and the web’s most popular encyclopaedia which is completely free to use for all. If you feel like you have the resources to part with a few dollars per month to support Wikipedia, and haven’t already done so, then please do. [2]

Please let me know if there are any others I’ve missed out.`,
